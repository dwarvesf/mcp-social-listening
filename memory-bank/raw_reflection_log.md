TaskRef: 'Convert JSON to Parquet data buffer and fix buggy function'

Learnings:
  - The `writeParquetData` function in `src/db/utils.ts` was commented out, leading to a "bug" where the conversion from JSON to Parquet data buffer was not occurring.
  - The return type for `writeParquetData` was incorrectly specified as `Promise<Buffer<ArrayBufferLike>>` and should be `Promise<Buffer>`.
  - The `parquetjs-lite` library is used for writing Parquet data to a buffer.
  - The `PassThrough` stream is used to capture the output of the Parquet writer into chunks, which are then concatenated into a single Buffer.

Difficulties:
  - Identifying that the function was commented out was the initial hurdle.

Successes:
  - Successfully uncommented the function and corrected its return type.
  - The `ParquetSchema` defined within the function appears to be correct for the `profiles` data.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
  - When a function is reported as "buggy", first check if it's actually being called or if it's commented out.
  - Ensure correct TypeScript return types for Node.js Buffer operations.
