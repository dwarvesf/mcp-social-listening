TaskRef: "Implement Reddit source support"

Learnings:

- Successfully added a new source type (`Reddit`) to the social listening system.
- Initially attempted to implement `RedditSource` as a class, but refined based on user feedback to directly use functions (`isRedditUrl`, `getRedditSource`). This simplifies the structure as the `Source` interface properties are handled by `SubmitSource` directly.
- Implemented URL validation for Reddit subreddit links using regex: `^https:\/\/www\.reddit\.com\/r\/[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+\/?$`. The regex was initially missing hyphens, which was corrected.
- Integrated the new source into `src/index.ts` by importing `getRedditSource` and `isRedditUrl`, and adding a new `else if` condition in the `add_new_source_to_social_listening` tool's `execute` function.
- Ensured proper alphabetical ordering of imports in `src/index.ts` and `src/lib/reddit.test.ts` to comply with ESLint rules.
- Created a dedicated test file `src/lib/reddit.test.ts` to validate the `isRedditUrl` and `getRedditSource` functions.
- Learned that `vitest run <file_path>` can lead to `ReferenceError: describe is not defined` if the global test environment is not fully loaded. Running `pnpm test` (which executes `vitest run` without a specific file path) resolves this by allowing Vitest to discover and run tests with the correct environment.

Difficulties:

- Initial TypeScript errors due to incorrect type assignments (`id` as `string` instead of `number`, `created_at` as `Date` instead of `string`) for the `Source` interface implementation when `RedditSource` was a class. Resolved by consulting `src/type.ts` and correcting the types.
- ESLint errors related to import order and function order within files. Resolved by reordering imports and functions alphabetically.
- Accidental duplication of import lines in `src/index.ts` during a `replace_in_file` operation, leading to "Duplicate identifier" errors. Resolved by carefully correcting the `replace_in_file` block to only reorder and not duplicate.
- User feedback indicated `RedditSource` class was unnecessary, requiring refactoring to remove the class and associated `fetchContent` method, and updating tests.
- Test failure for `isRedditUrl` due to regex not accounting for hyphens in subreddit names. Corrected the regex.
- `ReferenceError: describe is not defined` when running `pnpm test src/lib/reddit.test.ts`. Resolved by running `pnpm test` without specifying the file path, allowing Vitest to properly initialize its global environment.
- Loss of `memory-bank/raw_reflection_log.md` due to task interruption, requiring recreation of the entire log.

Successes:

- Successfully implemented the new Reddit source with proper URL validation and `SubmitSource` creation.
- All TypeScript and ESLint errors were resolved.
- Unit tests for the Reddit source were created and passed after necessary adjustments.
- The new source integration into the main application logic was successful.
- Successfully adapted to user feedback by refactoring the code to remove unnecessary class structure.
- Successfully debugged and resolved test environment issues (`ReferenceError: describe is not defined`) and regex issues.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- General pattern: When implementing new source types, consider if a full class implementing `Source` is necessary, or if direct functions returning `SubmitSource` are sufficient, especially if content fetching is handled separately or not immediately required.
- General pattern: Always refer to the `Source` and `SubmitSource` interfaces in `src/type.ts` for correct property types and order.
- General pattern: Pay close attention to import and function ordering to avoid ESLint errors.
- General pattern: Double-check `replace_in_file` operations to ensure no accidental duplication or incorrect modifications.
- Testing best practice: For Vitest, prefer running `pnpm test` (or `vitest run`) without specific file paths to ensure the full test environment is loaded and global test functions are available.
- Regex for URLs: Be thorough in considering all valid characters for URL components (e.g., hyphens in subreddit names).
